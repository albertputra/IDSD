# Drone
A military drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is used for military purposes. Military drones can be used for a variety of missions, including:

- **Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)**: Military drones can be used to gather intelligence on enemy positions and movements. They can also be used to conduct surveillance of areas of interest.
- **Target acquisition and designation**: Military drones can be used to acquire and designate targets for attack. This can be done by using the drone's sensors to identify the target and then transmitting the target's location to other forces.
- **Strikes**: Military drones can be armed with missiles or bombs and used to carry out strikes against enemy targets.
- **Resupply**: Military drones can be used to resupply troops on the ground with food, ammunition, and other supplies.
- **Evacuation**: Military drones can be used to evacuate wounded troops from the battlefield.

Military drones are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are being used in a wider range of missions. They are a valuable asset to the military and are likely to play an even greater role in future conflicts.

Military drones are a controversial weapon system. Some people argue that they are unethical because they allow operators to kill people without putting themselves in danger. Others argue that they are a necessary tool for the military and that they can save lives by allowing troops to stay out of harm's way.

The use of military drones is a complex issue with no easy answers. It is important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of this technology before making a decision about its use.
