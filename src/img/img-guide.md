# Image Guide
Upload and use images anywhere

## How to use
### Upload and rename
Upload file into here and rename with image type like `Kanone-M80-12cm.png` or `Kanone-M80-12-siegeGun.png`.

### Setup file url
Image url default is `https://kanaede.github.io/IDSD-Builds/src/img/` but if you create a new folder here you need add the folder name in the link.<br/>
Example you create a `tank` folder, you need to add `/tank/` and connect with the default link, then be like this `https://kanaede.github.io/IDSD-Builds/src/img/tank/`.

How to convert file to url?<br/>
After you find out which file is in which folder and create the folder link you need add file link.<br/>
You can make file link with add file name in the link, for example the file name is `Kanone-M80-12.png` so you need add that name into the link, then be like this `https://kanaede.github.io/IDSD-Builds/src/img/Kanone-M80-12.png`

### Note
You need rename file and replace `space` with `-`, `_` or removes the space and capitalizes the letter after the space, this is done to reduce the failure rate and make it a little prettier.<br/>
If you removes the space and capitalizes the letter after the space, it should look like this `KanoneM8012.png` but it's not very pretty to look at.
