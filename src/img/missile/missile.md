# Missile

A missile is a guided airborne ranged weapon capable of self-propelled flight usually by a jet engine or rocket motor. Missiles are thus also called guided missiles or guided rockets (when a previously unguided rocket is made guided).

Unguided jet- or rocket-propelled weapons are usually described as rocket artillery. Historically, the word missile referred to any projectile that is thrown, shot or propelled towards a target; this usage is still recognized today.

Missiles are used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Warfare: Missiles are used to attack enemy targets, such as ships, aircraft, and ground forces.
- Defense: Missiles are used to defend against enemy attacks.
- Space exploration: Missiles are used to launch satellites and spacecraft.
- Scientific research: Missiles are used to study the atmosphere and space.
- Commercial applications: Missiles are used for commercial purposes, such as launching weather balloons and inspecting pipelines.
  
Missiles are classified into different types based on their range, speed, guidance system, and warhead.

Here are some of the most common types of missiles:

- Ballistic missiles: Ballistic missiles are guided missiles that follow a ballistic trajectory, which is a curved path that is determined by the force of gravity. Ballistic missiles can be either short-range, medium-range, or long-range.
- Cruise missiles: Cruise missiles are guided missiles that fly at a relatively low altitude and follow a predetermined course. Cruise missiles can be either subsonic or supersonic.
- Air-to-air missiles: Air-to-air missiles are guided missiles that are fired from aircraft to attack other aircraft.
- Surface-to-air missiles: Surface-to-air missiles are guided missiles that are fired from the ground to attack aircraft.
- Surface-to-surface missiles: Surface-to-surface missiles are guided missiles that are fired from the ground to attack targets on the ground.
Missiles are a powerful weapon that can be used for a variety of purposes. However, they are also a dangerous weapon that can cause significant damage. It is important to use missiles responsibly and to ensure that they are used only for legitimate purposes.
